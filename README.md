# CayleyPermutationsInsEnc
 This is a python library for enumerating Cayley permutations with the insertion encoding.

 A Cayley permutation is a word π ∈ N∗ such that every number between 1 and the
 maximum value of π appears at least once. Cayley permutations can be seen as a
 generalisation of permutations where repeated values are allowed. Definitions of pat
tern containment and Cayley permutation classes follow the same ideas as defined
 for permutations where the patterns contained are also Cayley permutations, so the
 Cayley permutation class Av(11) describes all permutations. 

 There are two types of insertion encoding for enumerating Cayley permutations. The vertical insertion encoding inserts leftmost smallest values in the Cayley permutation and 
 

The horizontal insertion encoding is...

We have written code to enumerate Cayley permutations based on an implementation of vertical insertion encoding based of Vatter's method.
